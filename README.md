# AI-Based-utomated Financial Fraud Detection System 

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data by identifying unusual spending patterns. Using machine learning techniques like anomaly detection and classification algorithms, the project differentiates between legitimate and suspicious transactions. Credit card fraud detection helps financial institutions reduce monetary losses and protect customers from unauthorized activities. By recognizing fraud early, this project supports the security of electronic payment systems.
